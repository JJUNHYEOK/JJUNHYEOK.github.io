  Hi ! My name is Jun Hyeok. I am an undergraduate intern at the <mark><a href="https://bdss.gnu.ac.kr/" target="_blank">BigData System Software Lab</a></mark> at GNU, advised by <mark><a href="https://scholar.google.co.kr/citations?user=bUZe0WwAAAAJ&hl=ko&oi=ao" target="_blank">Jaeho Kim</a></mark>. I am interested in efficient data storage which in high demand these days, especially Solid-State-Drive (SSD). And I also use several algorithms about ML, for testing device reliability and life-cycle. Previously, I am studing with B.S. from GNU in Aerospace and Software engineering(not the double-major).

  I am most skilled in: <mark>Python</mark>, <mark>C</mark> and <mark>Football</mark>

          Actually, It's not the formal project. But I hope this process helps me to grow in our field. I have learned many concepts and contents through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. I wish I can keep doing this until graduate.

        #     Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.
